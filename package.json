The objective of the game is to find all sets of matching cards within a maximum of 3 tries/attempts. There will be a total of six (6) cards flipped face down at the start. The set will include 3 pairs of matching cards. The player must try to match all three pairs of cards in fewer than 3 attempts. An attempt doesn't represent just one card flip; rather, it involves comparing 2 cards in one try. If the cards don't match, they are flipped back to their face-down state, and the player's remaining attempts are reduced by one.<br><br> At the start of each new game, the cards must reshuffle to different positions and values. Note that you do not need to include special cards like Jacks, Queens, Kings, or Aces. Whether or not to include them is up to you; it will not earn you any extra points, however it could be a fun challenge if you're feeling adventurous.",
